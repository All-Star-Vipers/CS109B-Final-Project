### Milestones

#### Milestone 1  
We received positive feedback for this milestone. The main comment we received was to fix an error message that had appeared in the output. For the final submission, all output in this notebook is clean. In addition, the visualizations have been updated for the final genre encoding we decided to use.

We also received a comment that our initial list of questions seemed rushed. We took this comment into account for directing our future work but did not add questions to the notebook for this milestone.  

#### Milestone 2  
We received positive feedback for this milestone, but moved the Text Feature Engineering section from Milestone 3 to this notebook as it was more appropriate here. In addition, the final we approach we used to encoded genres has been updated in the milestone accordingly. 

#### Milestone 3
While we received positive feedback, we did get requests to include code within the notebook and show more comparisons between the models. The milestone notebook has been updated accordingly, with ROC curves addressing the latter request.  

#### Milestone 4
Our submission was incomplete due to delays in getting working deep learning models. This has been rectified and the entire Milestone has been redone to answer the questions fully and reflect the deep learning work done.

### Datasets

Includes the training and test sets, which together total 11,500+ records. We did not include the actual posters due to their large size, however the poster paths are in the dataset and all posters can be found in this [Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ns6ghyg1br4z592/AADgwfXDS4kHjQeFoCjvn1Jga?dl=0)
